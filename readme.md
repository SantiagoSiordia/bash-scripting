# Bash Scripting

## Scripting Tips

- Remember to make the shell scripts executable with the chmod command.
  
>  ```bash
>  chmod +x script.sh
>  ```

- Remember to start your script with a shebang!
  
>  ```bash
>  #!/bin/bash
>  ```

- It's a best practice to use the ${VARIABLE} syntax if there is text or characters that directly precede or follow the variable.
